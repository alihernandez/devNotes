# Switch Statements
A switch statement is like an if..else.. statment except for that instead of chaining ifs together there is on default case in the event that none of the cases match. An example would look like:
```
switch (level) {
	
	case 'One':
		title = 'Level 1';
		break;
		
	case 'Two':
		title = 'Level 2'};
		break;
		
	case 'Three':
		title = 'Level 3';
		break;
		
	case 'Four':
		title = 'Level 4'};
		break;

        }
```

The variable __level__ is the switch value. So if the vale is equal to the string **One** the the code for the first case fires and so on and so forth.
