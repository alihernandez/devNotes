# NoSQL
## CAP
---
**Describes Distributed Systems**
C — consistency — different nodes respond with the same data to the same request 

 A — availability — the system responds to a request, even if the system isn’t working or its data is outdated 
 
 P — partition tolerance — the system detects, remains operational during, and heals a partition caused by the failure of one or many nodes

## ACID
---
**Describes Databases**
A — atomicity — either all of the operations in a transaction succeed, or none of them do 

 C — consistency — the database enforces rules about its fields and the relationships between fields 
 
 I — isolation — the extent to which rows that a transaction is affecting can be affected by other transactions 
 
 D — durability — the database writes its data to a permanent medium (hard drive) so that data is not lost during a power failure or other system failure
