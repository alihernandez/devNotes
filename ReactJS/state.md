# State in React
State is when a component defines data locally within itself, can be defined as observable properties that control the behaviour of the component. The data is state is able to change over the lifecycle of the component. It is a plain JavaScript object used to represent any information about a components current situation. State variables are preserved by React even when their function exits. Local state is a feature only available to classes. A stateless component is preferable but it is unavoidable.
